## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There is still alot to learn, however i learnt a bit of constructor functions how the differ from factory functions. I also learnt how
complicated it is to do a calculator - thought i would do it quick, but nah. Also learnt a great way to change themes with complex
items that have multiple colours.

### Continued development

Algerithms and data structures i guess.
